# Markov-Decision-Processes
Consider the 3x3 world shown in the following figure:  
![image](https://github.com/Moaz2025/Markov-Decision-Processes/assets/105356707/09072475-8fb3-43d2-a1ae-b9a88fea41ff)  
The agent has four actions Up, Down, Right, and Left.
The transition model is as follows: 80% of the time the agent goes in the direction it selects; the rest of
the time it moves at right angles to the intended direction. A collision with a wall results in no
movement.

## Implementation
1. Implement value iteration for this world for each value of r below:  
• r = 100  
• r = 3  
• r = 0  
• r = -3  
2. Use discounted rewards with a discount factor of 0.99
3. Show the policy obtained in each case.
